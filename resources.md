I greatly appreciate massive efforts to make online knowledge and multimedia freely accessible to the world. Even more so when such content is available in secure [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) sites with an ad-free experience. But it is generally good to use [Adblock-Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) at all times.
