Hello there. I'm a first year Ph.D. candidate in Physics at [IQC Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/), and I specialize in Quantum Information and Superconducting Circuits. I recently graduated from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) with an undergrad degree in Engineering Physics.

I generally enjoy thinking about deep ideas at the intersection of Math, Physics and EECS. While enormous progress has been made in these subjects as separate fields, I think it's the connections between them that will push technology forward in fundamentally new ways.
