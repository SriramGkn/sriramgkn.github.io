Hello there. I'm a first year Ph.D. candidate in Physics at [IQC Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/). I recently graduated from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) with an undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d9-T--sAAAAJ&hl=en), [CV](https://sriramgkn.github.io/docs/CV_ram.pdf))

If there's one thing I've enjoyed all the way since high school till today, it is the power of geometric intuition. Geometric intuition underlies not just physics and mathematics, but practically everything humans can imagine and create.

Formally, I have a background in the theory and implementation of Quantum Information. Alongside, I've also developed a keen interest in the theories of statistical mechanics, random processes, dynamical systems, and convex optimization.

While I couldn't prioritize Machine Learning as an undergrad, I'm quite excited about teaching it to myself! I'm currently going through [these](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) wonderful lectures rigorously.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
