Hello there. I'm a first year Ph.D. candidate in Physics at [IQC Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/). I recently graduated from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) with an undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d9-T--sAAAAJ&hl=en), [CV](https://sriramgkn.github.io/docs/CV_ram.pdf)). Contact me at [sriramgk98@gmail.com](mailto:sriramgk98@gmail.com)

Broadly, I'm interested in Quantum Information and its realization using Superconducting Circuits. Alongside, I've also developed a keen interest in the theories of Statistical Mechanics, Stochastic Processes, Dynamical Systems, and Convex Optimization.



If there's one thing I've appreciated about science all the way since high school, it is the power of geometric intuition. Geometric intuition underlies not just physics and mathematics, but practically everything humans can imagine and create. While I couldn't prioritize Machine Learning as an undergrad, I'm quite excited about teaching it to myself! I'm currently going through [these](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) wonderful lectures rigorously.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
