Hello there. I'm a first year Ph.D. candidate in Physics at [IQC Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/). I recently graduated from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) with an undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d9-T--sAAAAJ&hl=en), [CV](https://sriramgkn.github.io/docs/CV_ram.pdf)). Contact me at [sriramgk98@gmail.com](mailto:sriramgk98@gmail.com)

Broadly, I'm interested in Quantum Information and its realization using Superconducting Circuits. Alongside, I've also developed a keen interest in the theories of Statistical Mechanics, Stochastic Processes, Dynamical Systems, and Convex Optimization.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
