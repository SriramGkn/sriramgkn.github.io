Hello there. I'm a first year Ph.D. student in Physics at [IQC Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/). I recently graduated from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) with an undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics.

Broadly, I'm interested in both the physics and math of Quantum Information. Alongside, I share a keen interest in the theories of Convex Optimization, Dynamical Systems, and Stochastic Processes.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
