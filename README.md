# Credits
Many thanks to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for this clean, free template.

To make your own github blog with the same template:
- Fork [this](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/) repository.
- Rename it as **your_github_username.github.io**
- Wait for a minute or two. Your site will be hosted by GitHub for free!
